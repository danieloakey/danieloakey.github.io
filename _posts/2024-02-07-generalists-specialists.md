A big debate in software engineering continues to divide opinion: is it better to be a generalist or a specialist?

Personally, I find it fairly hard to be a specialist in any single area of computing. I marvel at engineers with deep knowledge of the inner workings of PostgreSQL or Kubernetes or sorting algorithms, but I know that I don't find most topics compelling enough to go to that depth. I like learning a decent amount about a wide variety of different areas, so I guess I'm a generalist at heart.

The generalist--specialist divide is recursive, however. Being a programmer among managers and salespeople makes you the resident expert; being a programmer among other programmers might make you average.

Generalists shouldn't feel like their skills are less useful, however. Being able to make connections between diverse fields is a valuable skill in itself. For example, my interest in foreign languages fits nicely with software development when working on internationalisation and localisation -- a specialist colleague may know everything about Unicode but nothing about how what it's like to navigate an app outside the English-speaking world.

Beyond making connections, knowledge and skills can multiply to create a multidimensional combination. If you're above average in programming, that's one thing. If you're above average in programming, business and writing, that's super useful when someone needs a programmer who understands business and can write about it confidently. Hence scores of firms looking for people with [T-shaped skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).

The ability to learn and adapt is what I value most, since technology changes over time and there is only so much one can become skilled in. For me, it's important to at least be aware of many different things. For example, I'm not an expert at web security by any means, but I'm at least superficially aware of a range of exploits to look out for; online documentation can guide me the rest of the way when needed.

Being reasonably good (say, the top 25%) in an area of computing is quite feasible in practice. There are diminishing returns to going deep in a subject in constrast to [easy wins early on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). I'm aiming to improve myself in a few areas of interest: databases, functional programming, front-end UIs, and back-end apps. Hopefully a couple of hours will push my skills a decent way up the curve. On the other hand, life is short and time is finite, so I'll likely have to deliberately exclude many other areas of mild interest such as devops, object-oriented programming, and data engineering.

Ultimately, the world needs specialists _and_ generalists. Maybe one day I'll get deep into one really interesting thing. For now, though, I'll stick to doing what I'm doing, since that's what I enjoy.
